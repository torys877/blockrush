# Blockrush: Blockchain Performance Testing Tool

## Overview
Blockrush is a CLI tool designed for blockchain and smart contracts performance testing, specifically targeting Ethereum networks (EVM compatible). It enables users to simulate and analyze blockchain transaction throughput, contract interactions, and network performance under various load conditions.

## Key Features
- üöÄ Multi-threaded Transaction Testing
- üìä Performance Metrics Collection
- üîÑ Configurable Test Scenarios
- üìù Logging and Reporting
- üåê Supports Multiple Blockchain Networks

## Requirements
- Go 1.23+
- Ethereum (EVM) Node (Local or Remote)
- Docker (Optional)

## Installation

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/blockrush.git
   cd blockrush
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o blockrush
   ```

### Docker Setup
```bash
docker build -t blockrush .
```

## Configuration
Blockrush uses a YAML configuration file to define test scenarios. An example configuration is provided in `config/config_example.yaml`.

### Configuration Structure
- `app.node`: Ethereum node connection settings
  - `rpc_url`: Node RPC endpoint
  - `chain_id`: Network identifier

- `tests`: Define multiple test scenarios with:
  - `type`: Transaction type (`send` or `call` - i.e. `eth_sendRawTransaction` or `eth_call`)
  - `config`:
    - `senders`: Number of concurrent test executors
    - `duration`: Test duration in seconds
    - `tps`: Target transactions per second
    - `data_size`: Transaction payload size (`optional`)
    - `value`: Ethers to send in WEI (`optional`)
    - `contract`: Contract interaction details (`optional`. If contract is defined, `data_size` will be ignored. All senders must have the necessary permissions to call the functions)
      - `address`: Contract address
      - `function`: Contract function data
        - `name`: Function name
        - `abi`: Function ABI
        - `params`: Function arguments (must be in the same order as in the smart contract)
- `senders`: Define test senders private keys (the number of private keys must be equal to or greater than senders number specified in the tests - `each test uses the same sender addresses`)

### Example Test Scenarios
1. **Simple Transaction Test**
   - Send transactions without contract interaction (ethers between accounts, can be with payload)
   - Configurable sender count and throughput

2. **Contract Transaction Test**
   - Execute specific contract function calls via sending transactions to contract
   - Test contract interaction performance

3. **Contract Call Test** (not fully implemented, todo: there should be collected more precise metrics)
    - Execute simple contract function calls (eg. `view`, `pure`)
    - Test contract interaction performance

## Running the Tool

### Local Execution
```bash
# Run with default configuration (NOTE: before run - replace `<YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` in config/config_example.yaml with your contract address)  
./blockrush --config=config/config_example.yaml

# Customize configuration path
./blockrush --config=/path/to/custom/config.yaml
```

### Docker Execution
```bash
docker run --rm --network="host" -v $PWD/logs:/app/logs -v $PWD/config:/app/config -e CONFIG_PATH=/app/config/config_example.yaml blockrush
```

## Output and Metrics
Blockrush generates comprehensive performance reports including:
- Transaction success rates
- Transactions per second (TPS)
- Latency metrics
- Blocks metrics
- Gas consumption
- Error logs

Outputs are displayed in a human-readable table format and logged to `logs/` directory.
